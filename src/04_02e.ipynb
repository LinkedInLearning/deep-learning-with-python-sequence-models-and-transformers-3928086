    "**Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging** is a fundamental NLP task that assigns each token in a sentence its corresponding grammatical category, such as noun, verb, adjective, or adposition. In this tutorial, we walk through the use of Hugging Face pretrained models specifically trained for POS tagging. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "+ **Set up a token classification pipeline for POS tagging:** Create a pipeline that assigns grammatical tags to each token in a text.\n",
    "+ **Interpret and analyze POS tagging outputs:** Convert and explore the output data using Pandas for further analysis and visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we begin, please ensure that you have:\n",
    "+ A working knowledge of Python, including variables, functions, and basic object-oriented programming.\n",
    "+ Familiarity with deep learning model development in Python using Keras and TensorFlow.\n",
    "+ A Python (version 3.x) environment with the `tensorflow`, `keras`, `pandas`, `ipywidgets`, and `transformers` packages installed."
