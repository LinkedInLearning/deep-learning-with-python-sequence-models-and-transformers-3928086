    "In this tutorial, we illustrate **Topic Classification** (also known as topic labeling or content classification) - a technique used to assign predefined topics or categories, such as weather, sports, finance, and more, to a given piece of text. This approach is particularly useful for organizing and filtering large streams of textual data, such as news feeds or social media posts.\n",

    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "By the end of this tutorial, you will:\n",
    "+ **Build a topic classification pipeline:** Create an end-to-end pipeline that leverages pretrained models for topic labeling.\n",
    "+ **Interpret model outputs:** Analyze and understand the modelâ€™s predictions, including the assigned topic labels and their confidence scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "Before we begin, please ensure that you have:\n",
    "+ A working knowledge of Python, including variables, functions, loops, and basic object-oriented programming.\n",
    "+ Familiarity with deep learning model development in Python using Keras and TensorFlow.\n",
    "+ A Python (version 3.x) environment with the `tensorflow`, `keras`, `ipywidgets`, and `transformers` packages installed."

This model is specifically designed to classify news articles or short texts into topics based on the **IPTC taxonomy** (see https://www.iptc.org/std/NewsCodes/treeview/mediatopic/mediatopic-en-GB.html). The taxonomy covers a wide range of subjects, including categories like \"economy, business and finance,\" \"sport,\" \"science and technology,\" and \"environment.\""

The `'label'` represents the predicted topic (for example, \"economy, business and finance\" or \"sport\"), while the `'score'` indicates the model's confidence in that prediction. These results offer a practical demonstration of how the model interprets various types of news content. The output can be used to automatically categorize incoming text data, which is particularly useful for news aggregation and content filtering applications."
