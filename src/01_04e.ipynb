    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are a class of neural networks designed to work with sequential data by maintaining a memory of previous inputs. They are commonly used in natural language processing (NLP), time series forecasting, and speech recognition. In this tutorial, we will build an RNN using Keras and TensorFlow to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This is known as **Sentiment Analysis**. Sentiment analysis is a fundamental NLP task used in various applications, such as customer feedback analysis, social media monitoring, and opinion mining.\n",
